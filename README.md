# Cyclistic_bikeshare_case_study

#### Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The directorof marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, for Cyclistic executives to approve my recommendations, they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
